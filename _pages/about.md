I am a Research Fellow at [Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au/) at Deakin University, Victoria, Australia. I completed my PhD degree from Pattern Recognition and Data Analytics group (PRaDA) under the supervision of [A/Prof. Santu Rana](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=S9PwnMYAAAAJ&hl=en), [A/Prof. Sunil Gupta](https://personal-sites.deakin.edu.au/~sunilg/?_ga=2.184104422.1753328289.1661431642-1906180909.1656474726), [Dr. Thin Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=BlTfdtMAAAAJ) and [Alfred Deakin Prof. Svetha Venkatesh](https://svethav.github.io/) in the year 2018.

Research Interest
======
Aritificial Intelligence systems are vulnerable to various types of attacks such as Trojan or backdoor attacks, and adversarial attacks. My current research interest is to expose these attacks and to propose potential defense startegies to make AI safe to use.
