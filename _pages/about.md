I am a Research Fellow at University of Manchester, United Kingdom. Previously, I was a postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au/) at Deakin University, Victoria, Australia.

Research Interest
======
Artificial Intelligence systems are inherently vulnerable to a range of adversarial threats, including adversarial and backdoor attacks. My research is focused on developing robust mechanisms to enhance the trustworthiness and security of machine learning models, ensuring their safe and reliable deployment. I am particularly interested in advancing the understanding of Adversarial Machine Learning, as well as exploring areas such as machine unlearning, differential privacy, data manifold analysis, and out-of-distribution detection.
