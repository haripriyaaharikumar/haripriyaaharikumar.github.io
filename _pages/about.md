I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au/) at Deakin University, Victoria, Australia. I completed my PhD degree from the Pattern Recognition and Data Analytics group (PRaDA) under the supervision of [A/Prof. Santu Rana](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=S9PwnMYAAAAJ&hl=en), [A/Prof. Sunil Gupta](https://personal-sites.deakin.edu.au/~sunilg/?_ga=2.184104422.1753328289.1661431642-1906180909.1656474726), [Dr. Thin Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=BlTfdtMAAAAJ) and [Alfred Deakin Prof. Svetha Venkatesh](https://svethav.github.io/) in the year 2018.

Research Interest
======
Artificial Intelligence systems are vulnerable to various types of attacks such as Trojan or backdoor attacks, and adversarial attacks. My research interest is to develop mechanisms to understand Adversarial Machine Learning such as adversarial attacks, and backdoor attacks. I focus on building frameworks to defend against such attacks in machine learning models to make them trustable and safe to use.
