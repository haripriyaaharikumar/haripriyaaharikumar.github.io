I am a Research Fellow at [University of Manchester](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/haripriya-harikumar), United Kingdom. Previously, I was a postdoctoral Research Fellow at Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute at Deakin University, Victoria, Australia.

Research Interest
======
Artificial Intelligence systems are inherently vulnerable to a range of adversarial threats, including adversarial and backdoor attacks. My research centers on developing mechanisms for AI Safety and Security, spanning both fundamental theory and practical deployment. I focus on ensuring that AI systems remain secure, trustworthy, and robust, particularly in adversarial or malicious settings. This includes designing methods that preserve the privacy of sensitive data and enable reliable predictions and safe decision-making under adversarial threats and distribution shift. I am also deeply interested in the underlying principles of out-of-distribution detection, data manifold learning, machine unlearning and the robustness of Language Vision Models (LVMs) and Large Language Model(LLMs). I aim to make AI-driven technologies, such as healthcare tools, online platforms, and autonomous systems, more reliable and safer for everyone to use.
