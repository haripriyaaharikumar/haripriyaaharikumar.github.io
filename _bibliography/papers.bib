  title={Scalable Backdoor Detection in Neural Networks},
  abstract={Recently, it has been shown that deep learning models are
  vulnerable to Trojan attacks, where an attacker can install a backdoor
  during training time to make the resultant model misidentify samples
  contaminated with a small trigger patch. Current backdoor detection
  methods fail to achieve good detection performance and are computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel trigger reverseengineering based approach whose computational complexity does not
  scale with the number of labels, and is based on a measure that is both
  interpretable and universal across different network and patch types. In
  experiments, we observe that our method achieves perfect score in separating Trojaned models from pure models, which is an improvement over
  the current state-of-the art method.},

  title={Privacy-Preserving Neural Processes for Probabilistic User Modeling},
  author={Amir Sonee, Haripriya Harikumar, Alex Hämäläinen, Lukas Prediger, and Samuel Kaski},
  abstract={Uncertainty-aware user modeling is crucial for designing AI systems that adapt to users in real-time while addressing privacy concerns. This paper proposes a novel framework for privacy-preserving probabilistic user modeling that integrates uncertainty quantification and differential privacy (DP). Building on neural processes (NPs), a scalable latent variable probabilistic model, we enable meta-learning for user behaviour prediction under privacy constraints. By employing differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), our method achieves rigorous privacy guarantees while preserving predictive accuracy. Unlike prior work, which primarily addresses privacy-preserving learning for convex or smooth functions, we establish theoretical guarantees for non-convex objectives, focusing on the utility-privacy trade-offs inherent in uncertainty-aware models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy under stringent privacy budgets. Our results showcase the potential of privacy-preserving probabilistic user models to
   enable trustworthy AI systems in real-world interactive applications.},
