  title={Scalable Backdoor Detection in Neural Networks},
  abstract={Recently, it has been shown that deep learning models are
  vulnerable to Trojan attacks, where an attacker can install a backdoor
  during training time to make the resultant model misidentify samples
  contaminated with a small trigger patch. Current backdoor detection
  methods fail to achieve good detection performance and are computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel trigger reverseengineering based approach whose computational complexity does not
  scale with the number of labels, and is based on a measure that is both
  interpretable and universal across different network and patch types. In
  experiments, we observe that our method achieves perfect score in separating Trojaned models from pure models, which is an improvement over
  the current state-of-the art method.},

  title={Composite Concept Extraction through Backdooring},
  author={Banibrata Ghosh* and Harikumar, Haripriya* and Doan, Khoa and Venkatesh, Svetha and Rana, Santu},
  abstract={Learning composite concepts, such as "red car", from individual examples—like
a white car representing the concept of "car" and a red strawberry representing
the concept of "red"—is inherently challenging. This paper introduces a novel
method called Composite Concept Extractor (CoCE), which leverages techniques
from traditional backdoor attacks to learn these composite concepts in a zeroshot setting, requiring only examples of individual concepts. By repurposing the
trigger-based model backdooring mechanism, we create a strategic distortion in
the manifold of the target object (e.g., "car") induced by example objects with the
target property (e.g., "red") from objects "red strawberry", ensuring the distortion
selectively affects the target objects with the target property. Contrastive learning
is then employed to further refine this distortion, and a method is formulated for
detecting objects that are influenced by the distortion. Extensive experiments with
in-depth analysis across different datasets demonstrate the utility and applicability
of our proposed approach.},

  title={Privacy-Preserving Neural Processes for Probabilistic User Modeling},
  author={Amir Sonee* and Harikumar, Haripriya* and Hämäläinen, Alex and Prediger, Lukas and Kaski, Samuel},
  abstract={Uncertainty-aware user modeling is crucial for designing AI systems that adapt to users in real-time while addressing privacy concerns. This paper proposes a novel framework for privacy-preserving probabilistic user modeling that integrates uncertainty quantification and differential privacy (DP). Building on neural processes (NPs), a scalable latent variable probabilistic model, we enable meta-learning for user behaviour prediction under privacy constraints. By employing differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), our method achieves rigorous privacy guarantees while preserving predictive accuracy. Unlike prior work, which primarily addresses privacy-preserving learning for convex or smooth functions, we establish theoretical guarantees for non-convex objectives, focusing on the utility-privacy trade-offs inherent in uncertainty-aware models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy under stringent privacy budgets. Our results showcase the potential of privacy-preserving probabilistic user models to enable trustworthy AI systems in real-world interactive applications.},
